Neural Network algorithm demonstration

File Structure:
readme.txt
forest_nn
analysis
total_results

Development Environment:
My script was developed RStudio Version 1.3.1056

Usage:
Install RStudio. Open file in RStudio and change the code according to you dataset for various situations and run it.


File Description 
forest_nn- file in R language covering objective of by forestfire dataset
analysis- This file contains the different outcome of r function to observe the output and act accordingly on forestfire dataset
total_results - It is an set of results of accuracy figure on forestfire dataset 



objective:- 
PREDICT THE BURNED AREA OF FOREST FIRES WITH NEURAL NETWORKS


Note :- I have added some png files which are the different graphs on both the datasets for EDA and result observation purpose. Also added the snapshot dataset.
